- pushwalls don't work
- wrong icon (icon.bmp) (not really a bug, but whatever)
- fucks out on standby (if closed lid during gameplay)
- works only on shareware, no full version or sod (shareware or full)
- modified exit messages (a/b instead of y/n): that's just WRONG
- performance: not as fluid as lazy1's port
