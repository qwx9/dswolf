- pushwalls don't work
    . the wallpic displayed once the wall is pushed all the way is
    wrong: should be the original wallpic from when the wall was
    intact, but is the wallpic of the block "behind" it
- wrong icon (icon.bmp) (not really a bug, but whatever)
- fucks out on standby (if closed lid during gameplay)
- works only on shareware, no full version or sod (shareware or full)
    wl6 works fine if commenting out #define SHAREWARE
    that leaves out spear and sdm
- modified exit messages (a/b instead of y/n): that's just WRONG
- performance: not as fluid as lazy1's port
- controls: shitty; no controls for gun selection, etc.
- lower screen -> print banner, then status messages
- dogs: wrong sounds (dying, hits?)
- shitty delay between going to the menu and going back in game
- music: listen to main menu music: not everything is being played
    compare to dosbox, etc.
- big fps drop when repeating current music track
- pause can be cancelled by hit a key repeatedly
    lazy1 port: breaks pause only if a/b/x/y pressed once
- actors spawning bugs, behaviour not at all like in original
    can be seen in e1m1, just compare the soldiers between the two
