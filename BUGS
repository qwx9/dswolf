- pushwalls don't work
    . the wallpic displayed once the wall is pushed all the way is
    wrong: should be the original wallpic from when the wall was
    intact, but is the wallpic of the block "behind" it
    . savegames issues possible? seem to work fine...
- fucks out on standby (just close the lid)
- works only on shareware, no full version or sod (shareware or full)
    wl6 works fine if commenting out #define SHAREWARE
    that leaves out spear and sdm
- controls: shitty; no controls for gun selection, etc.
    -> a screen a la ecwolf
- lower screen -> print banner, then status messages
- shitty delay between going to the menu and going back in game
- music: listen to main menu music: not everything is being played
    compare to dosbox, etc.
    . seems that some instruments are maybe too quiet, but can be heard
- big fps drop when repeating current music track
- pause can be cancelled by hit a key repeatedly
    lazy1 port: breaks pause only if a/b/x/y pressed once
- actors spawning bugs, behaviour not at all like in original
    can be seen in e1m1, just compare the soldiers between the two
    seems to affect only patrolling enemies, check it
- usage of file streams for binary files
    . just use open instead, we don't care about portability
    . fseek -> lseek
- bugs on full screen size:
    . poor fps (not very fluid, compare to lazy1)
    . intermission screen draws a crapped out HUD when it shouldn't
- got "length or dest is null!" on finishing e1m1 once, could not reproduce.
- overwriting a savegame: the new text is being drawn over the old one w/o
  clearing
- occasional visual glitches
    . relatively frequent in e1m2
