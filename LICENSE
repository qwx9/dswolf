dswolf uses code from several projects, and some are licensed differently.

    * The original source code of Wolfenstein 3-D:

        Its license can be found in the LICENSE.id file.

    * The Nintendo DS port of Wolfenstein 3-D by Steven Taffs (aka "happy
      bunny"), as seen at https://code.google.com/p/wolfenstein-3d-nds/:

        No license found in the project files...

    * An alpha release of the Nintendo DS port of Wolfenstein 3-D by "Lazy1"
      (http://lazyone.drunkencoders.com):

        No license found in the project files...

    * wolf4sdl, a port of Wolfenstein 3-D to the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)
      library, by Moritz "Ripper" Kroll (http://www.chaos-software.de.vu):

        As far as I can tell, it uses the same license as Wolfenstein 3-D, e.g.
        LICENSE.id.

    * DSx86's AdLib emulation code:

        Its license can be found in arm7/source/adlib.s.
        It covers the following files:

            - arm7/source/adlib.s
            - arm7/source/audio.c
            - arm7/source/fn_tab.s
            - arm7/source/sin_tab.s
            - arm7/source/tl_tab.s

The AdLib emulation code excepted, the rest of the code in this project is
licensed under the 3-Clause BSD License, which can be found in the
LICENSE.dswolf file.
