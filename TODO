- don't require a specific directory where the gamefiles are to be
  located, instead try current directory, then a default one
    stat() works just fine, the problem is that the current working directory
    is / instead of current working directory; apparently, need cart w/ argv
    support for that
- one executable for all versions of the game
    . remove shitty ifdefs
        actually, most are removed (SPEAR, SPEARDEMO)
        SHAREWARE was defined in types.h
- use lower screen for SOMETHING
- option to swap screens
- option to use stylus for movement
- restart or shutdown on error
- quit -> restart or shutdown
- refactor code
    keep old id structure?
    . use int where it doesn't matter, instead of {S,U}32
    . use signed/unsigned ints intelligently, where it actually matters
    . headers are a clusterfuck right now
- savegame naming? how does it work?
- brightness a la doom?
- sound volume?
- strive for savegame compat?
- eliminate senseless limitations for levels?
- improve code based on carmack's own suggestions
    . see RELEASE.TXT
    . see TODO from lazy1's project files
